#World Tour Work Flow

- Created new Laravel app
- Followed the instructions within instructions.md In order up until Step 13
- Created a public facing page at the root.
- Began organizing an admin page to edit tours
	- contains a panel for each tour and stops within the body
	- there are edit/delete buttons for each object
	- There is a button on each tour to add a new stop.
- Currently you can add only add tours.
- The ability to add stops is still in progress
- Neither stops nor tours can be edited or deleted yet.
